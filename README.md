# ReactMVP
This is my first react program!
It's just a webpage API and Database that work together to load up some images of sandwiches.

## Installations
This project uses PG,CORS,Express,Nodejs and React. Make sure to install and import these in your own project.
```
npm install pg
npm install cors
npm install Express
npm install Node
```
These are the modules that are required for functionality.

## Usage 
Donwload code and use a a semi fleshed out template to innovate and add on to.

## Suggestion use Git ignore
Add these files to your .gitignore so you dont have excessive files. 
``` 
# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```

## Contributing 
There's no adding to this program its barebones enough and is a good skeleton for some other form of project.
